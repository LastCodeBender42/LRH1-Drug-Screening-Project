This information is fundamental for understanding protein function, including enzymatic activity, molecular recognition, and signaling pathways. These networks also aid in predicting important protein properties such as stability, flexibility, and solubility, which are crucial for protein engineering and drug design. By identifying key residues and interactions, researchers can pinpoint critical sites that stabilize the protein structure or mediate specific functional roles, guiding both experimental studies and computational predictions. Comparative analysis of protein structures helps to reveal evolutionary relationships, structural motifs, and functional similarities or differences among proteins. Additionally, protein structure networks facilitate structure-based drug design by identifying potential targets for therapeutic agents. They also support molecular dynamics and simulation studies, enabling researchers to predict how mutations or environmental changes affect protein stability and function. Moreover, these networks allow for the systematic analysis of protein-protein interactions, elucidating how proteins form complexes and cooperate in biological processes. In the field of structural bioinformatics, protein structure networks serve as a foundation for developing algorithms and tools for protein structure prediction, analysis, and visualization, thereby advancing research in molecular biology and biophysics.</font>\n","\n","<font size='4'>In summary, the RING server is a powerful tool in structural bioinformatics that facilitates the analysis,
